mpr -> stands for model, predictions, results; all of this is places in a directory named this way, after 'mpr' comes the name of the model, each model has a corresponding .ipynb 
mpr_baseline1 -> simple model, very bad results, it has beedn scraped
mpr_baseline_take2 -> simple model that works but please use the 'twin' version 
mpr_baseline_take2 -> on bert we are using n kernels of convolution and that is that. It was named twin in hope that it can be run with the original because they are using too much memory but the simple %store command that python notebooks have isn't exactly sharing memory between processes, it only serializes the object and reads it back
mpr_baseline2 -> is using one layer of attention 
mpr_baseline3 -> is the same as baseline_take2_twin but it has one more added hidden layer and regularization
